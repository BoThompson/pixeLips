This is a script to generate talking animations using a properly set up Aseprite file with layers and
a Papagayo lipsync script.

## What is Papagayo?
It's an open source and free tool for creating the timing scripts for lipsyncing. The basic idea is that
you load up an audio clip in it, enter the text in a box in the bottom and then have it attempt to auto-generate
the correct mouth shapes based upon the text and the clip. You then may need to do some cleanup by adjusting where
each word and mouthshape was placed in the timeline in the center. You can export this script (a pgo file) for usage
in various animation programs that have the ability to read it! (And with this script, Aseprite has become the first
pixel art program to do so!)
